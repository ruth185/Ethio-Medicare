It is simply fingerprint based patient management system. We propose to develop networked desktop application that will be user friendly using 2 major local languages.The system notifies patients a few days earlier and on the exact date of their scheduled appointment with SMS. Confirmation, scheduling and rescheduling is only done by the physician. Besides reminding, system will keep patients medical history and record. System will also generate report whenever needed. Also patient’s information is shared among laboratory, pharmacy and diagnostics.
